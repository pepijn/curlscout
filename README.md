Curlscout
=========

A long time customer called me: "Why is my website redirecting to not-the-clients-website.com?" Oops, a low-traffic website  became the casualty of an (incorrectly) updated nginx configuration. Two days ago.

That afternoon, `curlscout` was born. A small and therefore excellent family member in a world of wonderful tools:
